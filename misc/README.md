## MixamoDownloader
A simple js for mass-downloading resources from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/). It is based on [this repo](https://github.com/gnuton/mixamo_anims_downloader) that mass-downloads all the animations of one chosen character from Mixamo. With customisable parameters, the script supports downloading of multiple animations of multiple characters.

In addition, the original script faces the problem when downloading meshes with texture - such resources are large files so multiple fetch requests are sent at the same time, and as a result, the Mixamo server will reject further requests causing downloads unsuccessful. A quick fix is to include a sleep promise after each download to avoid too many files being downloaded from the server at the same time.
